## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate and organized computer engineering student with a deep interest in building scalable, maintainable software systems and open source contributor

- 🧠 I love understanding how things work under the hood (especially in databases, architectures, and low-level systems like operating system, network applications).
- 🧩 I believe in **learning by building** — every project is a chance to master a new skill.
- 📚 Currently focused on mastering:
  - Clean Architecture & Domain-Driven Design & Test Driven Design (TDD)
  - SQL Server Internals & Infrastructure
  - Microservices with .NET
  - Frontend frameworks like Angular & React & Blazor
