## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate and disciplined computer engineering student focused on building scalable, maintainable, and well-architected software systems.

- 🧠 I enjoy understanding how systems work under the hood — especially databases, software architecture, networking, and low-level concepts.
- 🧩 I believe in **learning by building** — every project is an opportunity to deepen my engineering skills.
- 🏗️ I aim to become a well-rounded full-stack engineer with strong backend and architectural foundations.

### 📚 Currently Mastering

- Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD) & Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- SQL Server Internals & Database Engineering
- Microservices & Distributed Systems with .NET
- Frontend frameworks: Angular, React & Blazor
- AI integrations using OpenAI APIs
